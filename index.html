  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Dylan Eberhardt, and I am a cybersecurity student with a deep passion for understanding how technology works beneath the surface. 
    What started as a curiosity about computers quickly grew into a fascination with how systems communicate, how data flows, and how vulnerabilities 
    can be exploited or prevented. I’m driven by the idea that every device, every network, and every line of code has a story — and I want to understand 
    that story from the inside out.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m especially interested in the intersection of cybersecurity and software development. The more I learn about coding, the more I realize how 
    important secure development practices are. Writing code isn’t just about making something work — it’s about making something resilient, efficient, 
    and safe. Whether I’m experimenting with front‑end development, exploring backend logic, or studying network security concepts, I’m always looking 
    for ways to strengthen my understanding of how systems can be protected from modern threats.
  </p>

  <p>
    My long‑term goal is to work in a field where I can actively defend systems, analyze vulnerabilities, and contribute to building a safer digital 
    world. Cybersecurity is constantly evolving, and that’s exactly what excites me — there’s always something new to learn, a new challenge to solve, 
    and a new skill to develop.

  <h2>Why I Love Coding</h2>
  <p>
    Coding gives me the ability to create something out of nothing — to take an idea and turn it into a real, functioning piece of technology. 
    I enjoy the problem‑solving aspect of programming, especially when I’m debugging or optimizing code. There’s something incredibly satisfying 
    about identifying an issue, understanding why it happens, and crafting a solution that makes everything run smoothly.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m particularly drawn to the logic behind programming. Every function, variable, and structure has a purpose, and learning how they all 
    interact feels like solving a puzzle. As I continue to grow as a developer, I’m excited to explore more languages, frameworks, and tools 
    that will help me build more complex and secure applications.

  <h2>My Cybersecurity Journey</h2>
  <p>
    Cybersecurity is more than just protecting systems — it’s about understanding how attackers think. I’m fascinated by the mindset behind 
    ethical hacking, penetration testing, and vulnerability analysis. Learning how to identify weaknesses in a system helps me understand how 
    to build stronger defenses.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve spent time studying topics like encryption, authentication, network protocols, and common attack vectors. The more I learn, the more 
    I realize how important cybersecurity is in every industry. From personal devices to large‑scale enterprise networks, security plays a 
    critical role in keeping information safe.
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is to continue expanding my knowledge through hands‑on labs, certifications, and real‑world experience. I want to contribute to 
    a future where technology is not only innovative but also secure by design.
